# Storyboard authoring — Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell (Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, Alan Eagle) · Vox engine

Vox = photoreal Flux stills + kinetic type. For EVERY beat decide what a viewer with the SOUND OFF
must see. Each image costs money and a wrong one is worse than none. ENGLISH only.
Book context: `books/trillion-dollar-coach-the-leadership-playbook-of-silicon-valley-s-bill-campbell/story-bible.json` — world/era: 1990-2016.

## Output — one object per beat in your chunk, same order, same `i`

## The image test (most important)
`image.subject` is a DESCRIBED PHOTOGRAPH — who, doing what, where, when — never a keyword list
("heart, manuscript, 1985" is forbidden). A muted viewer must guess the sentence from it. Reuse a
character's look VERBATIM so the same person recurs:
- Bill Campbell: a stocky white-haired man in his sixties, warm and direct, wearing a plain open-collar shirt and a sport jacket, the posture of a football coach
- Steve Jobs: a slim man in his forties with a black mock turtleneck, jeans and sneakers, intense focused gaze
- Larry Page: a young man in his late twenties with tousled brown hair and a casual sweater, thoughtful expression
- Sergey Brin: a young man in his late twenties with curly dark hair and a casual open shirt, animated expression
- Eric Schmidt: a man in his fifties with short graying hair and a dark blazer over an open-collar shirt, measured and attentive
- Jonathan Rosenberg: a man in his fifties with short dark hair and a light blazer, engaged and conversational
- A manager: a woman in her thirties with shoulder-length brown hair and a cardigan, sitting across a desk from a colleague
Keep the era right (no anachronisms). Flux drops gore, children in danger and war violence
(CONTENT_FILTERED) — soften to aftermath, symbol or place. No text inside images.
## Coverage — a muted viewer needs a picture most of the time
Give 70-85% of beats an image. The mute-test bar (image ADDS on >= 60% of ALL frames) cannot
be met otherwise: All the Light had images on 44% of its screen time and failed on text-only frames
while its images scored 14/15. An idea with no photograph still has a place, a person or an object
that carries it (the reader at a desk, the ruined street, the radio). `statement` with image null
only for pure banter or when every picture would mislead.
ONLY `imagefocus`, `polaroid`, `compare` and `duo` put a picture on screen. An image on any other
type (list, question, place, quote, stat, punchline, timeline…) is never shown — the planner turns such
a beat into imagefocus. Keep 15-30% of beats as those text archetypes WITHOUT an image where the shape
is the point (a real question, a real list, a real quotation): 40 minutes of one layout loses viewers.

Return ONLY a JSON array for your chunk. Validate it parses and matches every `i`.
