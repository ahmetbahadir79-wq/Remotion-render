# Storyboard authoring — Die with Zero: Getting All You Can from Your Money and Your Life (Bill Perkins) · Antidote engine

You art-direct an animated summary. The audio is a two-host analysis. For EVERY beat decide what a
viewer with the SOUND OFF must see to understand what is being said. A wrong picture is worse than
none. Everything you write is ENGLISH. Book context: `books/die-with-zero/story-bible.json`.
Reference (approved, We Were Liars): `books/we-were-liars/art.json` — read 10 beats of it first.

## Output — one object per beat in your chunk, same order, same `i`

## The icon test (most important)
Pick a `concept` only if a muted viewer seeing that icon WITHOUT the callout would guess the right
meaning. The icon's LITERAL reading must be the beat's claim — a metaphor the viewer has to decode
is read literally (Fahrenheit 451: chains for "numbness" read as "links", a medical cross for an
execution read as "healthcare", a coin for "the price we pay" read as "debt"). NEVER because a word
matches ("treating this TEXT as" is not a phone; "romance is the wrong reading" is not a heart).
What viewers actually read (measured in mute tests — data/icon-readings.json):
- medical: reads as healthcare, a hospital, being treated. NEVER for: an execution, a lethal injection, an injury while fleeing, an overdose handled coldly (read as benign care, F451 x3)
- phone: reads as a MODERN smartphone. NEVER for: any world before ~2000: 1950s TV walls, radios, telephones (read as smartphone anxiety, F451)
- star: reads as a glowing decorative star. NEVER for: a character introduction or anything specific (read as nothing, F451)
- heart: reads as love, romance
- fire: reads as fire, burning. NEVER for: a job described as 'cleaning' unless the fire itself is the subject
- mask: reads as a false public face, pretending
- mirror: reads as self-image, reflection. NEVER for: appearance, looks or vanity, judging yourself against others (read as appearance-checking, the-courage-to-be-disliked readcheck #17 #109 #229)
- city: reads as a standing, intact city. NEVER for: a city being destroyed (it is drawn intact, F451)
- food: reads as a dinner plate with fork and knife, literal eating. NEVER for: a metaphor of consuming or enjoying anything else (read as dining, F451)
- coin: reads as money, finance. NEVER for: a metaphorical price, cost or reckoning (read as financial debt, F451)
- door: reads as a way in or out, exclusion. NEVER for: 'no way out'
- puppeteer: reads as one person controlling others
- chains: reads as bound, imprisoned, controlled (drawn intact). NEVER for: numbness, stupefaction, silenced writers, surrender to technology, links or continuity (F451 holdout1+2: 4 misreads, read as 'links' / 'history')
- boulder: reads as a heavy burden sitting in the path. NEVER for: an internalized or reflective weight, or stress that comes from home/family (read as a burden others dumped on you, the-courage-to-be-disliked readcheck #283; also mutes a 'this weight is not yours' reveal, #1)
- crack: reads as an abstract orange branching line (blind viewers do NOT see a crack). NEVER for: cultural rot, conflict, a breakdown of society (F451 holdout2+3: described 3x as an abstract branching structure)
- clock: reads as time, a deadline. NEVER for: speed, environmental distortion, a lack of mental silence (read as literal schedule time, F451 x2)
- balance: reads as weighing two sides, fairness, justice. NEVER for: a critique, a reframing, a verdict on society (an empty tipped scale read as nothing, F451)
- shield: reads as protection
- trophy: reads as status, a prize. NEVER for: weakness
- hourglass: reads as time running out. NEVER for: an epidemic, a cost, a price paid (read as 'time passing', F451)
- target: reads as aiming at a goal, being targeted. NEVER for: where an idea came from, its origins (read as irrelevant, F451)
- gift: reads as a present, giving away
- inheritance: reads as a will, an estate, an heir
If nothing reads literally: `concept: null` and stage the PEOPLE doing the idea (face + body +
object) with a strong callout. A wrong icon is worse than none.
No single shared icon on more than 5% of the beats: an icon used for everything means nothing.

## Negation, irony, fakery
When the narration says NOT / never / fake / scripted / pretend / hollow X, never stage X plainly
(F451: a warm embrace for "fake scripted validation" read as genuine warmth; a thoughtful face for
"he is NOT thinking about the ideas" read as valuing them). Stage the contrast instead: the empty
face beside the smiling screen, the forced smile (say so), the turned back.
Two people side by side must look clearly different (build, age, costume); two men in the same
uniform read as "identical men" — stage one of them.

## Staging the people (the picture must carry meaning, not only the text)
This is non-fiction: the 'cast' is usually `everyman` (the reader living the idea) or the author/host. Stage the idea as a person doing it: exhausted -> slump + worried, focused -> think, spending -> holds wallet/coin, time -> holds hourglass, choosing -> point. Use `narrator` only for pure show commentary. Named people (researchers, the author, case-study subjects) go on screen when the story bible has them.
Never happy over death or tragedy unless it is a fake smile.

## Callouts
2-5 words, the narrator's own concrete words from THIS beat; correct ASR spellings of names.
Every callout of 4+ words needs a function word (the/of/to/her/...), no keyword soup, max 7 words /
48 chars. `strike` = the narrator REJECTS the phrase; never for emphasis. No invented labels.
Every beat needs a callout OR a diagram OR an icon; pure banter ("Right.") may carry only staging.

## Diagrams (about 1 per 25 beats, only on structural beats)
flow = cause -> effect (2-3 labels, 1-2 words each, from the narration); sorter = 2-4 buckets;
spectrum = [left, right] + values[0..1]; matchWave = two rhythms syncing. A diagram beat has
concept null and callout null. Avoid bare template words as labels (DENIAL, CHANGE, GROWTH) — use
the narrator's phrase ("Family denial").

Return ONLY a JSON array for your chunk. Validate it parses and matches every `i`.
