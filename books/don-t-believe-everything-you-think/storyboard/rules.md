# Storyboard authoring — Don't Believe Everything You Think (Joseph Nguyen) · Antidote engine

You art-direct an animated summary. The audio is a two-host analysis. For EVERY beat decide what a
viewer with the SOUND OFF must see to understand what is being said. A wrong picture is worse than
none. Everything you write is ENGLISH. Book context: `books/don-t-believe-everything-you-think/story-bible.json`.
Reference (approved, We Were Liars): `books/we-were-liars/art.json` — read 10 beats of it first.

## Output — one object per beat in your chunk, same order, same `i`

## The icon test (most important)
Pick a `concept` only if a muted viewer seeing that icon WITHOUT the callout would guess the right
meaning. The icon's LITERAL reading must be the beat's claim — a metaphor the viewer has to decode
is read literally (Fahrenheit 451: chains for "numbness" read as "links", a medical cross for an
execution read as "healthcare", a coin for "the price we pay" read as "debt"). NEVER because a word
matches ("treating this TEXT as" is not a phone; "romance is the wrong reading" is not a heart).
What viewers actually read (measured in mute tests — data/icon-readings.json):
- medical: reads as healthcare, a hospital, being treated. NEVER for: an execution, a lethal injection, an injury while fleeing, an overdose handled coldly (read as benign care, F451 x3)
- phone: reads as a MODERN smartphone. NEVER for: any world before ~2000: 1950s TV walls, radios, telephones (read as smartphone anxiety, F451)
- family: reads as abstract geometric shapes (blind viewers do not see a family). NEVER for: caregiving, a household, relatives (Southern Book Club: read as a lamp and shadows)
- star: reads as a glowing decorative star. NEVER for: a character introduction or anything specific (read as nothing, F451)
- heart: reads as love, romance
- fire: reads as fire, burning. NEVER for: a job described as 'cleaning' unless the fire itself is the subject
- mask: reads as a false public face, pretending
- mirror: reads as self-image, reflection. NEVER for: appearance, looks or vanity, judging yourself against others (read as appearance-checking, the-courage-to-be-disliked readcheck #17 #109 #229)
- city: reads as a standing, intact city. NEVER for: a city being destroyed (it is drawn intact, F451)
- food: reads as a dinner plate with fork and knife, literal eating. NEVER for: a metaphor of consuming or enjoying anything else (read as dining, F451)
- coin: reads as literal cash on hand, plain endorsement of money. NEVER for: a vow about money, a doubt about money, or money-as-metaphor (die-with-zero readcheck: 2 misreads) — the attitude must come from the words and people, or the viewer reads endorsement
- door: reads as a way in or out, exclusion. NEVER for: 'no way out'
- puppeteer: reads as one person controlling others
- chains: reads as bound, imprisoned, controlled (drawn intact). NEVER for: numbness, stupefaction, silenced writers, surrender to technology, links or continuity (F451 holdout1+2: 4 misreads, read as 'links' / 'history')
- boulder: reads as a heavy burden sitting in the path. NEVER for: an internalized or reflective weight, or stress that comes from home/family (read as a burden others dumped on you, the-courage-to-be-disliked readcheck #283; also mutes a 'this weight is not yours' reveal, #1)
- crack: reads as an abstract orange branching line (blind viewers do NOT see a crack). NEVER for: cultural rot, conflict, a breakdown of society (F451 holdout2+3: described 3x as an abstract branching structure)
- clock: reads as time, a deadline. NEVER for: speed, environmental distortion, a lack of mental silence (read as literal schedule time, F451 x2)
- balance: reads as weighing two sides, fairness, justice. NEVER for: a critique, a reframing, a verdict on society (an empty tipped scale read as nothing, F451)
- shield: reads as protection
- trophy: reads as status, a prize. NEVER for: weakness
- hourglass: reads as time running out. NEVER for: an epidemic, a cost, a price paid (read as 'time passing', F451)
- target: reads as aiming at a goal, being targeted. NEVER for: where an idea came from, its origins (read as irrelevant, F451)
- gift: reads as a present, giving away
- inheritance: reads as a will, an estate, an heir
If nothing reads literally: `concept: null` and stage the PEOPLE doing the idea (face + body +
object) with a strong callout. A wrong icon is worse than none.
No single shared icon on more than 5% of the beats: an icon used for everything means nothing.

## This book's own icons (drawn for it — use them whenever the beat is ABOUT that thing)
- twoArrows: The Two Arrows — a person with two arrows stuck in their body, one dark and one red
- thoughtGauge: Thoughts-per-minute gauge — a speedometer gauge with the needle in the red zone
- muddyGlass: Glass of muddy water — a tall glass of water with brown mud settled at the bottom and the water above it clearing
- checkEngine: Check-engine light — a car dashboard check-engine warning light in amber
- thoughtCloud: The sky and the clouds — a wide blue sky with white clouds drifting across it

## How staging reads (measured in mute tests)
- worried + talk: reads as SHOCKED (open mouth) — never for suppressed anger or quiet worry; use worried + slump or think (SBC #166)
- neutral face in closeUp: carries nothing — a close-up needs a face that IS the claim (SBC #88/#179/#220)
- neutral + idle, no icon: an empty frame: only the callout speaks — stage the person DOING the idea or give an icon (SBC: 24 beats)
- cast order: the FIRST cast member is drawn as the lead — put the person the sentence is ABOUT first (SBC #59 showed Carter on "the women do not feel safe")
- happy on the antagonist: reads as a FRIENDLY man — the muted viewer does not know he is the villain. Use smirk (charm with an edge) or angry for the threat; happy only for genuine warmth (SBC run6 #2/#78/#108)
- physical states the rig cannot draw: biting and a death scene with blood are still not drawn. Lying, collapsed, falling, fighting, struggling and grabbing ARE actions now (2026-09-28, rows below): never again stage "lies paralyzed on the floor" with standing people (SBC #189 read as nothing happening)
- action lying: reads as LYING DOWN on a bed (blind: "lying", "lying down" in wide and bust framing) — for in bed / ill / resting / lying awake. The rig's low bed is sometimes read as a bench or treadmill: put it in a room set
- action collapsed: reads as FALLEN / FAINTED — a body sprawled on the floor, eyes shut (blind: "fallen", "fainting") — for collapses, knocked out, found on the floor, dead
- action falling: reads as FALLING — tipped, airborne, flailing, motion streaks (blind: "falling") — for falls, trips, being pushed; afraid/surprised face
- action fighting: WITH a second cast member reads as FIGHTING (blind: "fighting", a scuffle with impact bursts); ALONE it reads as "fuming" — an angry man thrusting a fist. merge refuses it alone
- action grabbing: WITH a second cast member reads as GRABBING (blind: "grabs the startled boy by the arm"); the partner is drawn struggling. ALONE it reads as "walking". merge refuses it alone
- action struggling: WITH a second cast member (drawn grabbing) reads as BEING GRABBED and pulling away (blind: "grabbing", "flinches back"); ALONE it reads as "recoiling / startled". merge refuses it alone
- action reach: alone with no motif it reads as "waving" — reach needs its subject on screen (an icon or held object)
- crowd / multiple figures: the crowd shot repeats ONE person many times — viewers see ghost duplicates, never "a community"
- new faces (2026-09-26): angry = threat, rage, confrontation · smirk = sinister charm, manipulation, the predator smiling · blank = apathy, numbness, indifference ("pure apathy") · afraid = fear, terror (surprised is NOT fear: it reads as "wow")

## Negation, irony, fakery
When the narration says NOT / never / fake / scripted / pretend / hollow X, never stage X plainly
(F451: a warm embrace for "fake scripted validation" read as genuine warmth; a thoughtful face for
"he is NOT thinking about the ideas" read as valuing them). Stage the contrast instead: the empty
face beside the smiling screen, the forced smile (say so), the turned back.
Two people side by side must look clearly different (build, age, costume); two men in the same
uniform read as "identical men" — stage one of them.

## Staging the people (the picture must carry meaning, not only the text)
This is non-fiction: the 'cast' is usually `everyman` (the reader living the idea) or the author/host. Stage the idea as a person doing it: exhausted -> slump + worried, focused -> think, spending -> holds wallet/coin, time -> holds hourglass, choosing -> point. Use `narrator` only for pure show commentary. Named people (researchers, the author, case-study subjects) go on screen when the story bible has them.

Physical situations are real poses — use them instead of standing people when the sentence is about the body. fighting / grabbing / struggling need TWO cast members (alone they read as fuming / walking / recoiling):
- `lying`: lying in bed / resting / ill / lying awake (the rig brings its own bed)
- `collapsed`: fainted / knocked out / dead / lies on the floor (eyes shut, bare floor)
- `falling`: falls / trips / is pushed / plunges
- `fighting`: a fight or an attack — the lead punches toward the second cast member, who fights back
- `struggling`: straining to break free / resisting / being held — the second cast member holds them (grabbing)
- `grabbing`: grabs / seizes / snatches someone or something — the second cast member struggles
Never happy over death or tragedy unless it is a fake smile.

## Callouts
2-5 words, the narrator's own concrete words from THIS beat; correct ASR spellings of names.
Every callout of 4+ words needs a function word (the/of/to/her/...), no keyword soup, max 7 words /
48 chars. `strike` = the narrator REJECTS the phrase; never for emphasis. No invented labels.
Every beat needs a callout OR a diagram OR an icon; pure banter ("Right.") may carry only staging.

## Diagrams (about 1 per 25 beats, only on structural beats)
flow = cause -> effect (2-3 labels, 1-2 words each, from the narration); sorter = 2-4 buckets;
spectrum = [left, right] + values[0..1]; matchWave = two rhythms syncing. A diagram beat has
concept null and callout null. Avoid bare template words as labels (DENIAL, CHANGE, GROWTH) — use
the narrator's phrase ("Family denial").
