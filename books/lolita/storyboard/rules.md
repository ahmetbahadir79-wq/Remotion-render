# Storyboard authoring — Lolita (Vladimir Nabokov) · Antidote engine

You art-direct an animated summary. The audio is a two-host analysis. For EVERY beat decide what a
viewer with the SOUND OFF must see to understand what is being said. A wrong picture is worse than
none. Everything you write is ENGLISH. Book context: `books/lolita/story-bible.json`.
Reference (approved, We Were Liars): `books/we-were-liars/art.json` — read 10 beats of it first.

## Output — one object per beat in your chunk, same order, same `i`

- cast (story-bible keys):
- `humbert` — Humbert Humbert (The narrator — a European émigré literature professor in his late 30s, writing a confession from a prison cell. Suave, erudite, manipulative; weaponizes beautiful prose to disguise predation.): Late-30s European man, tall lean build, dark swept-back hair, sharp angular face, wearing a tailored charcoal suit with white shirt and silk tie, professorial air
- `dolores` — Dolores Haze (The real victim — a 12-year-old American girl whom Humbert kidnaps and abuses. Chews gum, reads comics, plays tennis. Her actual voice is the silence Humbert's prose buries.): 12-year-old American girl, slight build, brown hair in a ponytail, wearing a plaid cotton dress and white sneakers, freckled face, looks like an ordinary schoolgirl
- `charlotte` — Charlotte Haze (Dolores's mother — a lonely, pretentious small-town widow who falls for Humbert. Humbert marries her solely to access Dolores. The comedy Humbert spins around her is the reader's moral anesthetic.): Mid-40s American woman, average build, blonde permed hair, wearing a floral print dress with pearl necklace, trying too hard to look sophisticated
- `quilty` — Clare Quilty (The dark mirror — a playwright-pornographer who shadows Humbert across America and eventually lures Dolores away. Simply Humbert without the literary talent to disguise himself.): Late-40s American man, heavy build, thinning dark hair, rumpled linen suit, dissolute appearance, cigarette-stained fingers, smirking face
- `annabel` — Annabel Leigh (Humbert's manufactured origin story — a childhood sweetheart on the Riviera who died of typhus. He uses her memory to frame his obsession as romantic fate rather than predation.): Young girl around 13, slight build, light brown hair loose to shoulders, wearing a white summer dress, Mediterranean seaside setting
- `nabokov` — Vladimir Nabokov (The author — discussed as the architect behind the trap. Built the novel so that the reader experiences how seductive rhetoric manufactures consent for the inexcusable.): 50s Russian-American man, stocky build, receding gray hair, round face, wearing a tweed jacket with bow tie, butterfly-collector air

## The icon test (most important)
Pick a `concept` only if a muted viewer seeing that icon WITHOUT the callout would guess the right
meaning. The icon's LITERAL reading must be the beat's claim — a metaphor the viewer has to decode
is read literally (Fahrenheit 451: chains for "numbness" read as "links", a medical cross for an
execution read as "healthcare", a coin for "the price we pay" read as "debt"). NEVER because a word
matches ("treating this TEXT as" is not a phone; "romance is the wrong reading" is not a heart).
What viewers actually read (measured in mute tests — data/icon-readings.json):
- medical: reads as healthcare, a hospital, being treated. NEVER for: an execution, a lethal injection, an injury while fleeing, an overdose handled coldly (read as benign care, F451 x3)
- phone: reads as a MODERN smartphone. NEVER for: any world before ~2000: 1950s TV walls, radios, telephones (read as smartphone anxiety, F451)
- family: reads as abstract geometric shapes (blind viewers do not see a family). NEVER for: caregiving, a household, relatives (Southern Book Club: read as a lamp and shadows)
- star: reads as a glowing decorative star. NEVER for: a character introduction or anything specific (read as nothing, F451)
- heart: reads as love, romance
- fire: reads as fire, burning. NEVER for: a job described as 'cleaning' unless the fire itself is the subject
- mask: reads as a false public face, pretending
- mirror: reads as self-image, reflection. NEVER for: appearance, looks or vanity, judging yourself against others (read as appearance-checking, the-courage-to-be-disliked readcheck #17 #109 #229)
- city: reads as a standing, intact city. NEVER for: a city being destroyed (it is drawn intact, F451)
- food: reads as a dinner plate with fork and knife, literal eating. NEVER for: a metaphor of consuming or enjoying anything else (read as dining, F451)
- coin: reads as literal cash on hand, plain endorsement of money. NEVER for: a vow about money, a doubt about money, or money-as-metaphor (die-with-zero readcheck: 2 misreads) — the attitude must come from the words and people, or the viewer reads endorsement
- door: reads as a way in or out, exclusion. NEVER for: 'no way out'
- puppeteer: reads as one person controlling others
- chains: reads as bound, imprisoned, controlled (drawn intact). NEVER for: numbness, stupefaction, silenced writers, surrender to technology, links or continuity (F451 holdout1+2: 4 misreads, read as 'links' / 'history')
- boulder: reads as a heavy burden sitting in the path. NEVER for: an internalized or reflective weight, or stress that comes from home/family (read as a burden others dumped on you, the-courage-to-be-disliked readcheck #283; also mutes a 'this weight is not yours' reveal, #1)
- crack: reads as an abstract orange branching line (blind viewers do NOT see a crack). NEVER for: cultural rot, conflict, a breakdown of society (F451 holdout2+3: described 3x as an abstract branching structure)
- clock: reads as time, a deadline. NEVER for: speed, environmental distortion, a lack of mental silence (read as literal schedule time, F451 x2)
- balance: reads as weighing two sides, fairness, justice. NEVER for: a critique, a reframing, a verdict on society (an empty tipped scale read as nothing, F451)
- shield: reads as protection
- trophy: reads as status, a prize. NEVER for: weakness
- hourglass: reads as time running out. NEVER for: an epidemic, a cost, a price paid (read as 'time passing', F451)
- target: reads as aiming at a goal, being targeted. NEVER for: where an idea came from, its origins (read as irrelevant, F451)
- gift: reads as a present, giving away
- inheritance: reads as a will, an estate, an heir
If nothing reads literally: `concept: null` and stage the PEOPLE doing the idea (face + body +
object) with a strong callout. A wrong icon is worse than none.
No single shared icon on more than 5% of the beats: an icon used for everything means nothing.

## How staging reads (measured in mute tests)
- worried + talk: reads as SHOCKED (open mouth) — never for suppressed anger or quiet worry; use worried + slump or think (SBC #166)
- neutral face in closeUp: carries nothing — a close-up needs a face that IS the claim (SBC #88/#179/#220)
- neutral + idle, no icon: an empty frame: only the callout speaks — stage the person DOING the idea or give an icon (SBC: 24 beats)
- cast order: the FIRST cast member is drawn as the lead — put the person the sentence is ABOUT first (SBC #59 showed Carter on "the women do not feel safe")
- happy on the antagonist: reads as a FRIENDLY man — the muted viewer does not know he is the villain. Use smirk (charm with an edge) or angry for the threat; happy only for genuine warmth (SBC run6 #2/#78/#108)
- physical states the rig cannot draw: there is NO lying, falling, fighting, biting or dying pose (actions: idle talk point celebrate slump think walk sit hold reach). "Lies paralyzed on the floor" drawn with standing people reads as nothing happening (SBC #189) — carry such moments with an icon/own icon, a set, or the survivor reacting
- crowd / multiple figures: the crowd shot repeats ONE person many times — viewers see ghost duplicates, never "a community"
- new faces (2026-09-26): angry = threat, rage, confrontation · smirk = sinister charm, manipulation, the predator smiling · blank = apathy, numbness, indifference ("pure apathy") · afraid = fear, terror (surprised is NOT fear: it reads as "wow")

## Negation, irony, fakery
When the narration says NOT / never / fake / scripted / pretend / hollow X, never stage X plainly
(F451: a warm embrace for "fake scripted validation" read as genuine warmth; a thoughtful face for
"he is NOT thinking about the ideas" read as valuing them). Stage the contrast instead: the empty
face beside the smiling screen, the forced smile (say so), the turned back.
Two people side by side must look clearly different (build, age, costume); two men in the same
uniform read as "identical men" — stage one of them.

## Staging the people (the picture must carry meaning, not only the text)
Put on screen the characters the sentence is ABOUT (not the host). Give them the face and body of the moment: grief -> sad + slump, fear -> worried, revelation -> surprised, a forced polite smile over pain -> happy (say so), accusing -> point, grasping -> reach, arriving/leaving -> walk. Give them the object they handle (letter, photo, key, cup).
Never happy over death or tragedy unless it is a fake smile.

## Callouts
2-5 words, the narrator's own concrete words from THIS beat; correct ASR spellings of names.
Every callout of 4+ words needs a function word (the/of/to/her/...), no keyword soup, max 7 words /
48 chars. `strike` = the narrator REJECTS the phrase; never for emphasis. No invented labels.
Every beat needs a callout OR a diagram OR an icon; pure banter ("Right.") may carry only staging.

## Diagrams (about 1 per 25 beats, only on structural beats)
flow = cause -> effect (2-3 labels, 1-2 words each, from the narration); sorter = 2-4 buckets;
spectrum = [left, right] + values[0..1]; matchWave = two rhythms syncing. A diagram beat has
concept null and callout null. Avoid bare template words as labels (DENIAL, CHANGE, GROWTH) — use
the narrator's phrase ("Family denial").
